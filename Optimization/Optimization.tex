\subsection*{Basic learning objectives}

These are the tasks you should be able to perform with reasonable fluency \textbf{when you arrive at our next class meeting}. Important new vocabulary words are indicated \emph{in italics}. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Use wolfram alpha to solve equations.
    \item Memorize the basic formulas for area and volume.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Advanced learning objectives}

In addition to mastering the basic objectives, here are the tasks you should be able to perform \textbf{after class, with practice}: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Find the formula for an function that we want to minimize or maximize.
    \item Be able to find a maximum or minimum value of a curve.
    \item State the conclusion to the optimization problem as a complete, descriptive sentence.
\end{itemize}

We have used many web tools to help us in our computations for this course. In this unit we are using \link{http://wolframalpha.com} and \link{http://desmos.com} to serve as graphing calculators for us. 

In this section we are trying to optimize various functions. When we say the word ``optimize'' we mean that we are trying to find the minimum or maximum output values of the function. For example, we might want to minimize costs or maximize profit.

First we want to show/remind you how useful \link{http://wolframalpha.com} is at solving equations.

\begin{question}
Find the number of solutions to the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
y&=x^3-4x\\
y&=x
\end{cases}
\]
\begin{solution}
The system has \answer{3} solutions
\begin{hint}
Either plot it in Desmos and count the number of intersection points or just type in both equations to wolfram alpha.
\end{hint}
\end{solution}
\end{question}



\begin{question}
Find the of solutions to the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
y&=x^3-9x\\
y&=-2x+6
\end{cases}
\]
\begin{solution}
There are $3$ solutions. 
When $x=-2$, $y=$ \answer{10}
When $x=-1$, $y=$ \answer{8}
When $x=3$, $y=$ \answer{0}

\begin{hint}
Either plot it in Desmos and count the number of intersection points or just type in both equations to wolfram alpha.
\end{hint}
\end{solution}
\end{question}
