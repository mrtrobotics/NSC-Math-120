\title{Percentages}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
We review the concept of percentages.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle


The word \emph{percent} means ``for each hundred.'' For example, saying Joseph earns $60\%$ as much as Elaine is saying he earns $\$60$ for each $\$100$ she earns.

To calculate a percentage, the relationship between the amount that constitutes the whole, called the \emph{reference amount} and the amount under consideration must be found. This is done via the following formula:

\begin{equation}\label{basicpercentage}
\text{Percentage}=\frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}}\times 100
\end{equation}

As an example,
\begin{equation*}
\frac{15}{25}\times 100=60
\end{equation*}
means that $15$ is $60\%$ of $25$.

The relationship in equation (\ref{basicpercentage}) can be used to find any of the three pieces---the percentage, the part, the whole---if the other two are known by using algebra to solve for the missing piece.

As an example, to find $70\%$ of $220$
\begin{align*}
70&=\frac{\text{Part}}{220}\times 100\\
70\div 100 &=\frac{\text{Part}}{220}\\
0.70\times 220 &=\text{Part}\\
154&=\text{Part}
\end{align*}
and so $70\%$ of $220$ is $154$.

\begin{question}
The label on a $12$ oz.\ can of Coca-Cola states that it contains $39$ grams of carbohydrates, accounting for $13\%$ of the recommended daily value. How many grams of carbohydrates are recommended daily?

\begin{hint}
\begin{equation*}13=\frac{39}{\emph{\text{Whole}}}\times 100\end{equation*}
\end{hint}
\answer{$300$} grams
