\maketitle

\emph{Consumer credit} plays a critical role in the modern economy. Credit allows a person to make a purchase immediately while deferring payment for the item until later. From buying a car or home to purchasing everyday goods like groceries or gasoline, credit has come to dominate the financial landscape. It is critical that you understand the process, risks, and benefits of credit so you can make wise personal financial decisions.

A person's ability to gain credit, referred to as \emph{credit worthiness}, is dependent on such things as the person's history of credit use, projected ability to repay borrowed money, and the amount of debt the person currently carries. Data about a person's creditworthiness is collected by a credit reporting agency. Three national agencies collect and compile information about consumers. This information is used to calculate a numeric score between 300 and 850 called a FICO score\footnote{The FICO score is named after an early collector of credit history, the \textbf{F}air \textbf{I}saac \textbf{Co}operation.} with higher scores indicate higher creditworthiness.

Since each company collects slightly different data your Fico score may vary slightly from one agency to the next.  When you apply for a type of credit, the lender requests your credit score from one or more of the national agencies and sets the terms of credit based on what the scores say about your creditworthiness. The difference between a high FICO score and a low FICO score can be a significant reduction in interest rate, resulting in the potential savings of thousands of dollars in interest over the life of a long-term loan.

\begin{question}
Use the calculator at \link{http://www.myfico.com/myfico/creditcentral/loanrates.aspx} to answer the following question. For a 60-month new auto loan of $\$10,000$, how much interest does a person pay over the life of the loan with each FICO score ranges shown?

The federal government regulates credit scores via the \textbf{F}air and \textbf{A}ccurate \textbf{C}redit \textbf{T}ransactions Act, or FACT Act. Basic information about the FACT act may be found at \link{http://www.fdic.gov/consumers/consumer/alerts/facta.html}. Additionally, the federal government tracks statistics involving the use of consumer credit that can be accessed through the U.S. Census Bureau. You will find the answers to the following questions on the Census Bureau's statistical abstract for Banking, Finance, \& Insurance at \link{http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/banking_finance_insurance/payment_systems_consumer_credit_mortgage_debt.html}.
