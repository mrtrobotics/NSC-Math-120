\title{Opportunity Cost}

\maketitle

Many activities have a financial cost and all have a cost in time and energy, but have you ever considered the cost in opportunity for an activity? \emph{Opportunity cost} refers to the best alternative choice that was foregone in the decision-making process. For example, if you spend \$1 on a soda, presumably you do so because you believe the soda is the best use of your \$1 at that time. In that case, the financial cost is just that \$1 but the opportunity cost is what you would have done instead if the soda purchase had not been available, such as a chocolate bar or the future interest you would have earned if you had put the dollar in an interest-bearing savings account instead.
