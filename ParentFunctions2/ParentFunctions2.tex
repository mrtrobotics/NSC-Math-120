\title{More Parent Functions}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
In this section we are introduced to the sine and cosine functions and the exponential and logarithmic functions.
\end{abstract}

\subsection*{Basic learning objectives}

These are the tasks you should be able to perform with reasonable fluency \textbf{when you arrive at our next class meeting}. Important new vocabulary words are indicated \emph{in italics}. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Know the basic shapes of each of the \emph{parent functions} $y=sin(x)$, $y=cos(x)$, $y=log(x)$, and  $y=10^x$.
	\item Be familiar with the constant $e\approx 2.718281828$.
	\item Know the basic characteristics of each parent function, and be able to plot them by hand.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Advanced learning objectives}

In addition to mastering the basic objectives, here are the tasks you should be able to perform \textbf{after class, with practice}: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Be able to evaluate logarithmic expressions.
	\item Know how to solve equations graphically and how to solve equations using \url{wolframalpha.com}.
	\item Be able to find a parent function to match data.
\end{itemize}
