\subsection*{Basic learning objectives}

These are the tasks you should be able to perform with reasonable fluency \textbf{when you arrive at our next class meeting}. Important new vocabulary words are indicated \emph{in italics}. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Understand how conditional probabilities can be used to detect hidden information.
	\item Understand how to use a known distribution to investigate the legitimacy of a data point.
    \item Understand the limits of such an investigation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Advanced learning objectives}

In addition to mastering the basic objectives, here are the tasks you should be able to perform \textbf{after class, with practice}: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Perform explicit calculations to get an approximate quantification of the chances of fraud.
\end{itemize}
