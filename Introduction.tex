\maketitle

For each day of class you will complete a pre-class activity that will prepare you for the day's content. Class time will be devoted to practicing techniques and skills and following up on questions. There will be very little time spent on lecturing during the course so it is important for you to come prepared by completing the pre-class assignments.

Each section comes with learning objectives. Please take these seriously, as they set the bar for the level of content that you should understand when you come to class and when you finish class. 

Click on ``Next Activity'' to proceed to the first activity.
