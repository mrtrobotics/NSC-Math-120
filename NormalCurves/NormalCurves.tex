\title{Normal Curves}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
We will delve more deeply into the statistics of normal curves.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

\subsection*{Basic learning objectives}

These are the tasks you should be able to perform with reasonable fluency \textbf{when you arrive at our next class meeting}. Important new vocabulary words are indicated \emph{in italics}. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Know the general shape of the normal curve.
    \item Understand the interpretation of standard deviation as a measure of how much the data is clustered around the mean.
    \item Use Wolfram Alpha to compute the standard deviation of a small data set.
    \item Use the Geogebra app to graphically understand $z$-scores.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Advanced learning objectives}

In addition to mastering the basic objectives, here are the tasks you should be able to perform \textbf{after class, with practice}: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Compute $z$-scores of data and the values of data points corresponding to specific $z$-scores.
    \item Understand the meaning of \emph{percentile}.
	\item Use a $z$-table to obtain percentiles for normal curves.
    \item Determine the percent of data that falls between certain parts of the normal curve.
\end{itemize}
